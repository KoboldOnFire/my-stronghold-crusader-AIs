1. All the AI packs are compatable with a variaty of Gold to start, but use the imrpoved goods preferably
2. Some of the AI are really long-tern killers and should only be used with an increase of attack force rate more than 1
3. Mess around with the Aic or Aiv if needed, I'm not perfect
4. All of my Mod packs use the Aiv of other creators as a base (for example everey improved)
